=========================
NumPy 1.8.0 Release Notes
=========================

This release supports  Python 2.6 -2.7 and 3.1 - 3.3.


Highlights
==========

Dropped Support
===============

Support for Python versions 2.4 and 2.5 has been dropped,

Support for SCons has been removed.


Compatibility notes
===================

numpy.diag, np.diagonal, and the diagonal method of ndarrays return a view
onto the original array, instead of producing a copy.

selecting multiple fields out of an array also produces a view.

The hash function of numpy.void scalars has been changed.  Previously the
pointer to the data was hashed as an integer.  Now, the hash function uses
the tuple-hash algorithm to combine the hash functions of the elements of
the scalar, but only if the scalar is read-only.

Numpy has switched its build system to using 'separate compilation' by
default.  In previous releases this was supported, but not default. This
should produce the same results as the old system, but if you're trying to
do something complicated like link numpy statically or using an unusual
compiler, then it's possible you will encounter problems. If so, please
file a bug and as a temporary workaround you can re-enable the old build
system by exporting the shell variable NPY_SEPARATE_COMPILATION=0.

New features
============

Euler's constant is now exposed in numpy as euler_gamma.



Changes
=======

General
-------

The function np.take now allows 0-d arrays as indices.

The separate compilation mode is now enabled by default.


Deprecations
============

General
-------

Use of non-integer indices has been deprecated. Previously float indices
were truncated to integers without warning.
