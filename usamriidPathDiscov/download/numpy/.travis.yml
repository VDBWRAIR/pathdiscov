  # We used to use 'setup.py install' here, but that has the terrible
  # behaviour that if a copy of the package is already installed in
  # the install location, then the new copy just gets dropped on top
  # of it. Travis typically has a stable numpy release pre-installed,
  # and if we don't remove it, then we can accidentally end up
  # e.g. running old test modules that were in the stable release but
  # have been removed from master. (See gh-2765, gh-2768.)  Using 'pip
  # install' also has the advantage that it tests that numpy is 'pip
  # install' compatible, see e.g. gh-2766...
